Use dynamic programming to determine the optimal overall revenue for subdividing a batch of batter to bake an assortment of cakes of different sizes. 
The volumes of batter needed for each cake size and the volume of the overall batch of batter are all integer multiples of some base volume unit. 
It can be assumed that the batter units are in cups. 
For example, 1 unit (1 cup) of batter may be enough for a mini-cupcake, 2 units of batter for a small cupcake, 10 units of batter for a small cake, etc. 
Thus, the goal will be to figure out the most profitable way to subdivide a batch of batter of a specified size into the volumes of different cake sizes.
